# Blurb

Let's be honest: We've all been bored before in class--bored enough to pull open a tab of solitaire or minesweeper and play it rather than listen to the monotonous droning of the professor during lecture. So, what if we took that concept and made it useful? What if we were given the chance to learn about a topic, say, Boolean operations, through a fun game instead of a lengthy class? That's where Boolean Bonanza comes in. A match-based, Candy Crush style game that involves matching logical blocks on a game board to evaluate and create boolean expressions.

# Basic Instructions

Players can traverse the board with WASD keys, and use the arrow keys to shift blocks around. The point is to move the blocks such that the expression in the entire row/column evaluates to true. In order to complete each level, players must meet the requirements of the round before running out of moves.
